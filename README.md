Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
    >Software engineering systematically apllies engineering principles, methods and tools to develop & maintain high quality software systems. It is important in such that utenables the creation of software applications & systems that power up various aspects of modern life.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
     >It has greatly improved healthcare.
     >Finance has been made easier.
     >Entertainment through social media.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
     >Planning:  involves defining the software’s purpose and scope, much like pinpointing our destination and plotting the best route
     >Requirements analysis: seeks to identify and record the precise requirements of the final users.
     >Design: The Design phase is all about building the framework
     >Coding: When engineers and developers get down to business and start converting the software design into tangible code.
     >Testing: It is when vulnerabilities are uncovered.
     >Deployment: Involves rolling out the meticulously tested and fine-tuned software to its end-users.
     >Maintenance: The maintenance phase is characterized by constant assistance and improvement, which guarantees the software’s best possible functioning and longevity and ensures it meets customer expectations.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
      >Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach where each phase of the project must be completed before moving on to the next. These phases typically include requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. It is suitable for projects like construction. While Agile focuses on iterative development, where the project is broken down into small, manageable units of work called “sprints.” Each sprint delivers a potentially shippable product increment. It is ideal for software development.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
      >A Software Developer, is responsible for designing, coding, testing, and maintaining software applications.
      >A QA Engineer ensures the quality of the software by systematically testing it to identify defects and ensure that it meets the specified requirements.
      >The Project Manager is responsible for overseeing the planning, execution, and successful completion of the software project.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
       >IDEs are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code e.g Visual studio code.
       >VCS are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g GIT hub.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
        >Challenges are: Xhanging requirements, Tight deadlines and technical debts.
        >Strategies to overcome are: Effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks and regular reassessent of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
         >Unit testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
         >Integration testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
         >System testing: Testing the entire system as a whole.
         >Acceptance testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
          >Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
          


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
          >Change this English statement to Spanish.
